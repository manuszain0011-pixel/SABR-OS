# 🌙 SABR OS: The Master Manual
## *Your Blueprint for Spiritual & Worldly Excellence*

Welcome to **SABR OS**. You are now holding the keys to a comprehensive "Life Operating System" designed to help you master your time, your wealth, and most importantly, your relationship with your Creator.

---

## 🌟 1. The SABR Philosophy
SABR stands for **Spiritual & Action-Based Resilience**. Unlike typical productivity apps that only focus on work, SABR OS treats your prayer, your health, and your career as one unified system.
- **Deen first**: Your spiritual status (SPI) is the lead indicator of your success.
- **Bento Logic**: Information is organized into clean, interactive "cards" that give you what you need at a glance.

## � 2. Phase 1: Your First 5 Minutes (Critical Setup)

### **Step A: Account Creation**
When you first open SABR OS, you will be greeted by the Landing Page.
1.  Click **"Get Started"** or **"Sign In"**.
2.  Create an account using your email. This ensures your data is securely synced to the cloud (Supabase) so you can access it on any device.

### **Step B: Configuration (Profile & Settings)**
Navigate to **Profile & Areas** in the sidebar. This is where you "tell" the system who you are.
1.  **Name & Bio**: Set your name and a "System Intention"—a short sentence about why you are using this OS.
2.  **System Defaults**: 
    - Set your **City and Country**. This is crucial for accurate **Prayer Times**.
    - Choose your **Default Currency** (USD, PKR, AED, etc.) for the Finance Hub.
    - Set your **Week Start** (Monday, Sunday, or Saturday).

### **Step C: Creating Your Life Areas (Essential)**
SABR OS uses "Areas" to categorize everything. Without Areas, your data will just be a long, messy list.
1.  Go to the **Areas Tab** on the Profile page.
2.  Create your core domains. We recommend:
    - **Spiritual (Deen)**: Everything related to worship.
    - **Career/Education**: Your professional growth.
    - **Financial**: Managing your wealth.
    - **Self-Care**: Health, habits, and wellness.
3.  *Why this matters:* Later, when you create a Task or a Project, you will link it to these Areas. SABR OS will then track your progress in each domain automatically.

## � 3. Phase 2: Spiritual Mastery (Ibadat Hub)

The **Ibadat Hub** is your spiritual cockpit.
- **Prayer Records**: Don't just check a box. Log your **Khushu** (focus) and whether you prayed **On-Time**. This feeds into your **SPI (Spiritual Performance Index)**.
- **SPI Points**: Earn points for every act of worship. Try to beat your record every day!
- **Quran Tracking**: Track your reading by Surah and Ayah. The system keeps your "Last Read" position so you can pick up exactly where you left off.
- **Dhikr**: Tap the digital Tasbih for Adhkar. It vibrates/pulses to keep you engaged.

## ⚡ 4. Phase 3: Worldly Mastery (Dunya Suite)

### **The Productivity Hierarchy**
SABR OS uses a "Top-Down" productivity method:
1.  **Goals**: High-level achievements (e.g., "Become a Web Developer"). Link these to an **Area**.
2.  **Projects**: Smaller chunks of work to reach a goal. Use the **Kanban Board** to drag tasks from *Backlog* → *In Progress* → *Done*.
3.  **Tasks**: Your daily "atomic" actions. Quick to add, easy to finish.

### **Finance Hub**
- **Transactions**: Log every coffee, bill, and paycheck.
- **Budgets**: Set a monthly limit for categories. The card will turn red if you are close to overspending!
- **Zakat**: Use the calculator to see your obligation based on your Nisab.

## 🌿 5. Phase 4: Mind & Knowledge

### **Wellness**
- **Habit Tracker**: Build consistency. Check habits daily to see your **Flame Streak** grow.
- **Journaling**: Use the **Mood & Energy** sliders to see patterns in your life. Write a "Gratitude List" to boost your mental health.

### **Knowledge Management**
- **Ideas**: "Brain dump" your thoughts before they disappear.
- **Notes**: Full markdown support for deep learning.
- **Resources**: Save YouTube links, articles, or PDFs.
- **Books**: Track your reading list and your progress through every book.

## 📱 6. Use It Like a Pro

### **Mobile Access**
SABR OS is fully responsive. Open the URL in your phone’s browser (Safari/Chrome) and select **"Add to Home Screen."** It will behave exactly like a native app.

### **The "Premium" UI**
- **Detached Filters**: Use the search bars at the top of each hub to find data instantly.
- **Glassmorphism**: The UI uses a "glass" effect. If things look blurry, check your **Dark Mode** settings at the bottom of the sidebar for the best experience.
- **3D Interactive Cards**: Hover your mouse over any bento card; it will tilt and react to your movement, giving you a tactile feel.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting
- **Data not appearing?** Ensure you are signed in.
- **Prayer times wrong?** Double-check your City/Country in the Profile settings.
- **App feels slow?** Refresh the page; because it uses Supabase, a quick refresh usually syncs any pending data.

**May your journey with SABR OS be one of growth, barakah, and ultimate success in both worlds.**
